    "3) Describe your best model in the implementation of the two-layer neural network. Describe your starting point, how you tuned  the hyperparameters, which stategies you did you use to improve the network, show the results of intermediate and final steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "4) **Cross validation** is a technique used to prove the generalization ability of a model and can help you find a robust set of hyperparameters. Please describe the implementation details of **k-fold cross validation** if you want to use it to find a best set of hyperparameter of the **Linear SVM classification** problem.\n",
